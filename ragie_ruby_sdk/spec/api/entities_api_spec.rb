  # unit tests for create_instruction
  # Create Instruction
  # Create a new instruction. Instructions are applied to documents as they are created or updated. The results of the instruction are stored as structured data in the schema defined by the &#x60;entity_schema&#x60; parameter. The &#x60;prompt&#x60; parameter is a natural language instruction which will be applied to documents. This feature is in beta and may change in the future.
